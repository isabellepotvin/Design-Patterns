# America's Next Top Robber

This program allows users to play a game that was created using the Singleton, Observer, and Factory design patterns. 
America's Next Top Robber is a two-player game where the users are competing against each other to collect 'gems' and to 
try and earn more points than their opponent. (More details are provided in the "How to Play" section of the application.)

## Design Patterns
- I have implemented the Singleton design pattern with both the timer manager and the NPCFactory.
- I have also used the Observer design pattern to observe if any of the WASD and/or arrow keys are pressed. If they are, 
  the input managers notify the functions that "move" the players.
- Finally, I used the Factory design pattern to create the 6 different types of gems throughout my game.
